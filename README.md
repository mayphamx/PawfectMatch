## Description
Pawfect Match is a web application that allows pet owners to connect with others in their neighborhood to schedule playdates for their pets.

Unlike mainstream social media, Pawfect Match provides a tailored platform for pet owners to foster community and simplify playdate coordination.

Users can create a profile for their pet with photos, personality traits, and activity preferences. They can then browse other local pet profiles and request playdates that work for both pet owners' schedules.

The app uses real-time chat to coordinate the details of each playdate. Pet owners can also create public meetup events inviting all app members.

Pawfect Match aims to help pet owners enrich their pets' lives through socialization while building meaningful relationships with their neighbors.
